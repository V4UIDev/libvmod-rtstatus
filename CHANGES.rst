This is a running log of changes to libvmod-rtstatus.

libvmod-rtstatus 1.2.1 (2016-08-18)
-----------------------------------

No functional changes.

Functions are now static and have prototypes, to work with the
stricter CFLAGS in use in Varnish Cache Plus.

This is what you get when you tag the release a bit early.


libvmod-rtstatus 1.2.0 (2016-08-18)
-----------------------------------

* Major update to improve code, build system and HTML/js
  readability. No new features.

This release is meant to be run with Varnish Cache Plus 4.1, but should
also work fine on Varnish Cache 4.1.
